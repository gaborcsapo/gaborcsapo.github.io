            <p class="text-justify">Hi! I’m Gabor a Computer Science major studying at <b>New York University Abu Dhabi</b>. I’m from Hungary, but thanks to my studies I lived for two years in the Middle East, for <b>one semester in Shanghai, China and soon I’ll be moving to New York</b>. 
            I didn’t always know that I wanted to be a Computer Scientist, but in my freshman year I realized that my passion lies in creation and building. Since then I’ve learnt a great deal about designing efficient software in class and in my free-time. I’ve had an <b>internships in Africa and in Germany</b>, while I also work as a freelancer mainly making websites. 
            I’m always out for an adventure, I love hiking, surfing and wakeboarding. I’m grateful to NYUAD for giving me the opportunity to travel to 15+ countries in the past 3 years of which I tried to make the best use of by learning about different cultures and life in many places.

          <h6 class="text-muted ">Summer 2015 - 2 months</h6>
          <p>Blitzbringer is a startup in Frankfurt, Germany working on releasing a crowdsourced delivery service. I worked there as an intern in a <b>team of 5 people</b>. My main task was to build a new website for them, which unfortunately they changed this summer. I certainly learnt a lot about <b>web design, business, marketing</b>, but the real learning outcomes were about life. I moved to a completely new city with zero help, zero people I knew and zero money and I had find a way to make the most out of what I had, which was a pleasant challenge.</p>

          <h6 class="text-muted ">Since Fall 2014</h6>
          <p>Many people need websites to showcase their works or to market themselves online. However, many of them don’t know how to make a good website, and that’s what I’m trying to help with. I created <b>two archives</b> for art professors where they can upload and store their works and I also designed an <b>internal news website</b> for a department at NYUAD. Working on these projects taught me how to deal with clients with no knowledge about tech, and helped me develop my project management habits. </p>

          <h3>DIYDictionary</h3>
          <p>This is a selfish project. When I moved a foreign language environment, I met countless new words that I wanted to learn myself. First, I wrote them on pieces of papers, but I kept losing them. I wished there had been an app to store the words electronically… Then I realized I’m a CS major, why not make one for myself?!? I was introduced at a <b>Hackathon in Shanghai</b> to Hybrid Apps. To try them out I used the <b>Ionic Framework with AngularJS and SQLite</b> to accomplish the task I set myself. I have a huge list of plans how to develop the project into a commercially available app.</p>

          <h3>Game Design</h3>
          <p>I like to have fun while I’m learning and the easiest way to do so is to design games. My very first program was a copy of the <b>Snake game</b> that I used to play on my Dad’s Nokia. I also created a <b>2D Creativity Puzzle Game</b>, that requires some serious brain power and the demolishment of mental walls to solve. I created that project to learn about Processing and animations. In my Software Engineering class we focused on software design patterns. We learnt about the Factory, Singleton, MVC, Decorator and Observer patterns by creating <b>board and card games</b>.</p>

          <h3>Visual Design</h3>
          <p>Graphic design is a crucial part of Software Development. People judge in 3 seconds whether to download an app, or whether to look at that blog post or not. We have to acknowledge that humans are visual mammals judging by the looks. It is important to have an eye for pretty design s to please every audience. I contributed to <b>logo designs, printout designs and a marketing campaign for the Burj Khalifa in Dubai</b>. My style for the web is the trendy <b>minimalist design</b> but I always want to spice it up with some unique ideas, which is true for most of the things I do. I often get my inspiration from the great artists of Bauhaus like Laszlo Moholy-Nagy.</p>

          <h3>Interactive Websites</h3>
          <p>The web holds countless opportunities to create web applications that leverage public data and digital services from a wide range of existing web products. I have played around with the <b>Instagram API, Google Maps API, Twitter API, Three.js, P5.js, CouchDB</b> and many more things to design some interesting web experiences.

          <h3>Amateur Travel Photography</h3>
          <p>I LOVE travelling and I never want to forget the beautiful places I have seen with my eyes. That is why I took up photography recently and my dream is to hang a thousand pictures above my fireplace by the time I get old. For now I’m mostly using my humble phone since I like travelling super light, but as the saying goes: not the camera makes the good photographer… If you’re interested, I put together <a href="https://goo.gl/photos/p3Rjq9RH8nSQYmpz8" target="_blank"><b>an album with some of my pictures</b>.</a>
